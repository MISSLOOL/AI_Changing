===== AI_Changing Plugin: Resources Setup =====

To complete the setup of the AI_Changing plugin, you need to add the following icon resources:

1. AIIcon_16x.png - 16x16 pixel icon for the small toolbar button
2. AIIcon_40x.png - 40x40 pixel icon for the standard toolbar button

These files should be placed in this Resources directory.

The icons should be visually representative of AI or chat functionality, such as 
a robot face, a chat bubble, or a stylized "AI" text.

You can use any image editing software to create these icons. Make sure they have 
transparent backgrounds for the best visual appearance in the UE5 editor.

For best results, use the following guidelines:
- Use a simple, recognizable design
- Ensure good contrast against both light and dark backgrounds
- Keep detail level appropriate for the size (especially for the 16x16 icon)
- Follow UE5 icon styling for consistency with the editor
